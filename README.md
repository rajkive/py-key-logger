## A simple keylogger implemented in python

### Requirements

**Files**
- keylogger.py
- run.py for execution

**Dependencies**
- subprocess
- smtplib
- re
- pynput.keyboard
- threading


Note: We need an email address where the program will send the log every 120 seconds

*Would also recommend using a venv for importing/installing all the dependneices so they don't collide with the global ones*
